<h2>what makes up space?</h2>
Outer space refers to the area of ​​space outside the Earth's dense atmosphere, and there are no clear boundaries. Generally defined as space approximately 1000 kilometers away from the Earth's surface. Human curiosity and exploration of outer space have never been stopped. There is no clear boundary between space and Earth's atmosphere, as the atmosphere gradually thins with altitude. Assuming that the atmospheric temperature is fixed, the atmospheric pressure will decrease exponentially from 1000 mbar at sea level to zero as the altitude increases. The International Aviation Federation defines the Karman line at an altitude of 100 kilometers, which is the current boundary between the atmosphere and space. definition. The United States identifies people who reach an altitude of 80 kilometers as astronauts, and 120 kilometers is the boundary where air resistance begins to take effect during the spacecraft's return to Earth.
