Outer space refers to the area of ​​space outside the Earth's dense atmosphere, and there are no clear boundaries. Generally defined as space approximately 1000 kilometers away from the Earth's surface. Human curiosity and exploration of outer space have never been stopped. There is no clear boundary between space and Earth's atmosphere, as the atmosphere gradually thins with altitude. Assuming that the atmospheric temperature is fixed, the atmospheric pressure will decrease exponentially from 1000 mbar at sea level to zero as the altitude increases. The International Aviation Federation defines the Karman line at an altitude of 100 kilometers, which is the current boundary between the atmosphere and space. definition. The United States identifies people who reach an altitude of 80 kilometers as astronauts, and 120 kilometers is the boundary where air resistance begins to take effect during the spacecraft's return to Earth.

                <p>The first spacecraft to reach escape velocity was the Soviet Luna 1, which performed a fly-by of the Moon in 1959.[148] In 1961, Venera 1 became the first planetary probe. It revealed the presence of the solar wind and performed the first fly-by of Venus, although contact was lost before reaching Venus. The first successful planetary mission was the 1962 fly-by of Venus by Mariner 2.[149] The first fly-by of Mars was by Mariner 4 in 1964. Since that time, uncrewed spacecraft have successfully examined each of the Solar System's planets, as well their moons and many minor planets and comets.</p>

                        <p>The Moon was the first extraterrestrial planet on which humans have ever landed. The former Soviet Union's lunar program launched the first unmanned spacecraft to land on the moon in 1959, while NASA's Apollo program is the only manned lunar mission to date. The moon is the only natural satellite of the earth, with a diameter slightly larger than a quarter of the earth and a mass of about 1/81 of the earth. It is the largest satellite in terms of volume and mass relative to the planets it orbits, and the fifth largest in the solar system. It is also the second densest moon in the solar system.</p>

                            <p>Venus, a terrestrial planet, is often referred to as Earth's sister star because its size, mass, volume, and distance from the sun are similar to Earth's. However, it differs markedly from Earth in other respects. It has the thickest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets, more than 96% of which is carbon dioxide, and the atmospheric pressure on the surface of Venus is 92 times that of Earth. With an average surface temperature of 735 K (462 °C; 863 °F), it is the hottest planet in the solar system. Venus is covered in a highly reflective, opaque cloud of sulfuric acid that blocks visible light from space that might reach the surface. On September 15, 2020, scientists detected the presence of phosphine in the atmosphere of Venus, which may be a sign of extraterrestrial life.

The diameter of Mars is about half of that of Earth, the inclination of its axis of rotation and its period of rotation are comparable to those of Earth, but its orbital period around the sun is twice that of Earth. From Earth, Mars is visible to the naked eye and has a brightness of -2.91, only dimmer than Venus, the Moon and the Sun, but dimmer than Jupiter most of the time. Mars is the closest to the earth at 54 million kilometers (the farthest is 400 million kilometers, and the probe takes about 7 months to reach Mars).

                        <p>comet is an icy, small Solar System body that, when passing close to the Sun, warms and begins to release gases, a process that is called outgassing. This produces a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due to the effects of solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred meters to tens of kilometers across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma may be up to 15 times Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch beyond one astronomical unit. If sufficiently bright, a comet may be seen from Earth without the aid of a telescope and may subtend an arc of 30° (60 Moons) across the sky.</p>
